Extra Credit (worth two HW) 

Write a program that simulates a soft drink machine.  The program should use a structure that stores the following data:

Drink Name; Drink Cost; Number of Drinks in Machine

The program should create an array (size 5) using structures.  The elements should be initialized with the following data.

Drink Name            Cost          Number in Machine
Cola                  .75           20
Root Beer             .75           20
Lemon-Lime            .75           20
Grape                 .75           20
Cream Soda            .75           20

Each time the program runs, it should enter a loop that performs the following steps:  A list of drinks is displayed on the screen.  The user should be allowed to either quit the program or pick a drink.  If the user selects a drink, he or she will next enter the amount of money that is to be inserted into the drink machine.  The program should state the amount of change that would be returned and subtract one from the number of that drink left in the machine.  If the user selects a drink that has sold out, a message should be displayed.  The loop then repeats.  When the user chooses to quit the program it should display the total amount of money the machine earned.

input Validation: When the user enters an amount of money, do not accept negative values, or values greater than $10.00.

Generate a weekly report that will tell the vendor which soda sold the most, and which sold the least.  Also display the total gross-sales for all sales and the average of all sales.
