Parallel Arrays:  DriversLicenseExam.cpp

1) Write a program that will TEACH someone how to create a program using parallel arrays.  (to help, video on learning hub) using the following program challenge. 

Driver’s License Exam:  The local Driver’s License Office has asked you to write a program that grades the written portion of the driver’s license exam.  The exam has 15 multiple choice questions.  Here are he correct answers:

5. C   10. D   15. D   20. A


Your program should store the correct answers shown above in an array. It should ask the user to enter the student’s answers for each of the 20 questions. And the answers should be stored in another array.  After the student’s answer have been entered, the program should display a message indication whether the student passed or failed the exam.   student must correctly answer 10 of the 15 questions to pass the exam.)
