Create a program using the following structure:

struct PayRoll

{

   int empNumber;    // Employee number

   string name;          // Employee's name

   double hours;     // Hours worked

   double payRate;   // Hourly payRate

   double grossPay;  // Gross Pay

};

1. In the main(), declare a variable Employee with data-type Payroll.
2. from the main() Call a function called Payroll getinto() .  Get info will gather hours and payRate, as well as, calculate grossPay.  NOTE: input validations, make sure there is no negative hours entered, and make sure there is no negative payRate.

3. Return the "Payroll" variable used in getInfo() to the call.

4. From the main() display the content of employee.

5. Have the program run until the user is finished using it.
