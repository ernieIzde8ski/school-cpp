Circle.java

Write a Circle class that has the following fields:

radius: a double

PI: a final double initialized with the value 3.14159

The class should have the following methods:

Constructor. Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.

Constructor. A no-arg constructor that sets the radius field to 0.0

setRadius.  A mutator (setter) method for the radius field.

getRadius. An accessor(getter) method for the radius field.

getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as (area = PI *radius * radius)

getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as (diameter = radius*2)

getCircumference.  Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as (circumference = 2*PI*radius)

Write a program that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the circle's radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle's area, diameter and circumference.
