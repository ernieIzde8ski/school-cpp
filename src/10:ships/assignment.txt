We're going to be define a ship and 2 different types of ships in this program.

Ship.java

Design a ship class. 

- Add a field for the name of the ship (a string)
- Add a field for the year that the ship was built (a string)
- Add a constructor
- Add appropriate accessors and mutators
- Add a toString method that displays the ship’s name and the year it was built


CruiseShip.java

Design a CruiseShip class that extends the Ship class.

- Add a field for the maximum number of passengers (an int)
- Add a constructor
- Add appropriate accessors and mutators
- Add a toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. 
  - The CruiseShip class’s toString method should display only the ship’s name and the maximum number of passengers.


CargoShip.java

Design a CargoShip class that extends the Ship class.

- A field for the cargo capacity in tonnage (an int).
- Add a constructor
- Add appropriate accessors and mutators
- Add a toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class.
  - The CargoShip class’s toString method should display only the ship’s name and the ship’s cargo capacity.


ShipDemo.java

We're going to be demoing all three of your ship programs using an array.

- Create a Ship array.
- Assign various Ship, CruiseShip, and CargoShip objects to the array elements.
- Your program should then step through the array, calling each object’s toString method.


I've attached a UML to help.

Turn in all 4 programs when finished
