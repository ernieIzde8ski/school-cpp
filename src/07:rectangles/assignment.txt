Rectangle.java

In Class we created two classes.  RectangleDemo.java & Rectangle.java.

Recreate these programs.  First Rectangle.java 

NOTE: hand each one into their respective HW designations on learning hub, but only after you have the programs communicating with each other and working very well.

RectangleDemo.java
In Class we created two classes.  RectangleDemo.java & Rectangle.java.

Recreate these programs.  First Rectangle.java, then create RectangleDemo.java.  RectangleDemo.java will use the "new" memory allocation to launch Rectangle.java from the HardDrive and establish it as an object.
